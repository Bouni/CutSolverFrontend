# CutSolverFrontend

This is a simple vue frontend for my [CutSolver](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolver). 

This is also my first vue project, keep looking for other references if you want to learn it. 

I use:
1. IDE: WebStorm (while I have it)
1. Vue
2. Vue Bootstrap

Remember to set all versions for new releases:
 1. git tag
 2. package.json 
 3. Docker Multibuild?

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

Set the backend path by adding this to your environment:
`VUE_APP_BACKEND_SOLVER_URL=http://localhost:8000/solve`

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
