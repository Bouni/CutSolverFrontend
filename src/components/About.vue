        <p>This project was born out of the need to cut lengths of steel tubing. Ordering everything
            pre-cut is easy, but costs at least 30% more. I had everything I needed at home, but I needed to know how
            many stock bars to order and where to cut them. I finished that project years ago, but the problem keeps
            arising, which is why I finally caved in and developed this project. </p>

        <p>Look at more things I do: </p>
        <!-- IG, Thingiverse, Website, XING?, ... -->

        <p>I will be forever grateful if you donate something to keep this website up, right now I am
            paying around 5â‚¬/month to host this service. </p>
