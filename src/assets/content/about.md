## What is this?
This service collects your input, sends it to a big calculator, allows it to think about it for a while and 
displays the received result back to you.

Be aware that this is actually a very hard mathematical problem, google "bin packing problem". This means
that this calculator will only guarantee perfect results up to 12 elements, anything more will fall back to
a smart, but easily fooled algorithm. 

## FAQ
*Could this be done on this website, on my device, in the background?*

Probably, that could even be faster, but the calculator was here first ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

*Do you steal my valuable data and sell it to shady drug dealers on the black market?*

No, is that something that people do? Do I need to worry about that? To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with it.
If you have a nice project email me instead, so I can look at your fine work.

## Why did you build this?
This project was born out of the need to cut lengths of steel tubing. Ordering everything
pre-cut is easy, but costs at least 30% more. I had everything needed to trim them to size at home, 
but I needed to know how many stock bars to order and where to cut them. The usual solution is just staring 
at the problem until you see a solution, but that's not really how it should work. 

I finished that project years before looking for an answer, but the problem kept arising, which is why 
I finally caved in and developed this tool. 

## How can I thank you for this thing?
Tell me how you used this tool, happiness and being praised is the main reason I develop stuff like this. 

You could also donate some spare change, which is even better, but it's not like I could ask someone for that. 
I will be forever grateful if support me in keeping this website up, right now I am paying around 5€/month 
to make this service available for everybody.

## Where can I find more?
Look at more things I do by searching for "Modisch Fabrications". 
I am active on Instagram, Thingiverse, GitHub (duh) and sometimes soon on my personal website. 

## Development
Have a look at [CutSolverFrontend](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolverFrontend) if you want to see 
how this website works on the inside. You are welcome to add to it if you see any improvements :) 

You can send also jobs to my backend directly, see [CutSolver](https://github.com/ModischFabrications/CutSolver). 
Please don't abuse or break it. Feel free to send an issue or merge request or something if you find a vulnerability.
