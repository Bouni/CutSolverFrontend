**Work in Progress!**

# What it is
This service collects your input, sends it to a big calculator of mine, allows it to calculate for a while
    and displays the received result to you.

Could this be done on this website, on my device, in the background? 

Probably, that might even be faster, but the calculator was here first ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Do you steal my valuable data and sell it to illegal drug dealers on the black market? 
No, is that something that people do? Do I need to worry about that? To be honest, I wouldn't know what to do with it,
if you have a nice welding project send me an email instead so I can look at your fine work.

Be aware that this is actually a very hard mathematical problem, google "bin packing problem". This means
that this calculator will only guarantee perfect results up to 12 elements, anything more will fall back to
a smart, but easily fooled algorithm. 

Why it exists
This project was born out of the need to cut lengths of steel tubing. Ordering everything
pre-cut is easy, but costs at least 30% more. I had everything I needed at home, but I needed to know how
many stock bars to order and where to cut them. I finished that project years ago, but the problem keeps
arising, which is why I finally caved in and developed this project. 

Look at more things I do:
IG, Thingiverse, Website, XING?, ...

I will be forever grateful if you donate something to keep this website up, right now I am
    paying around 5€/month to host this service.

Check out the code if you want to see how I made it, you are welcome to add to it if you see any improvements :) 

You can send also jobs to my backend all by yourself, see ## . Please don't abuse or break it. Feel free to
send an issue or merge request or something if you find a vulnerability.
